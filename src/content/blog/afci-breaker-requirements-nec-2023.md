You finish wiring a bedroom addition and head to the supply house for breakers. The counter guy asks, "Need AFCI?" and you pause. The job is in a 2018 house, the addition connects to existing circuits, and you're not sure which AFCI rules apply. Get it wrong and you're looking at a failed inspection and an expensive trip back to swap breakers.

This complete guide to NEC 210.12 AFCI requirements cuts through the confusion, explains exactly where arc fault protection is required, and helps you choose the right breakers for every installation.

## What AFCI Protection Does (And Why You Need It)

Arc fault circuit interrupters detect dangerous electrical arcs that can start fires but won't trip standard breakers. Unlike ground faults that GFCI devices catch, arc faults occur between conductors or from damaged insulation, creating heat that ignites surrounding materials.

**Real-world arc fault causes**:
- Damaged wire insulation from nails or screws
- Loose connections in outlets and junction boxes
- Worn extension cords and damaged appliance cords
- Overdriven staples crushing NM cable
- Rodent damage to conductors

The Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that AFCI protection could prevent over 50% of electrical fires—that's about 28,000 fires per year.

## AFCI Requirements in NEC 210.12

### Current Requirements (2023 NEC)

**All 120-volt, 15- and 20-ampere branch circuits** supplying outlets or devices in the following areas require AFCI protection:

**Dwelling unit areas** (210.12(A)):
- Family rooms, dining rooms, living rooms, parlors, libraries, dens, bedrooms, sunrooms, recreation rooms, closets, hallways, laundries, and similar rooms or areas

**Dormitory unit areas** (210.12(B)):
- Bedrooms, living rooms, hallways, closets, bathrooms, and similar rooms or areas

**Guest rooms and guest suites** (210.12(C)):
- Bedrooms, living rooms, hallways, closets, bathrooms, and similar rooms or areas

### What's NOT Required

**Kitchen circuits**: Dedicated appliance circuits generally don't require AFCI
**Bathroom circuits**: Not specifically required, though may be required in dormitories
**Garage circuits**: Not required for garage areas
**Outdoor circuits**: Not required for outdoor locations
**Unfinished basement**: Not required for unfinished areas

### The Key Changes Over Time

**2008 NEC**: Bedrooms only
**2011 NEC**: Added family rooms, dining rooms, living rooms, etc.
**2014 NEC**: Added hallways, closets, and other areas
**2017-2023 NEC**: Maintained same requirements with clarifications

## Types of AFCI Protection

### Combination AFCI Breakers (Most Common)

**What they detect**:
- Series arcs (along a conductor)
- Parallel arcs (between conductors) 
- Ground arcs (conductor to ground)

**Where to use**: New installations, panel upgrades, circuit modifications

**Advantages**: Protects entire branch circuit, easier installation than outlet-type

### AFCI Outlet Devices

**What they provide**: Same protection as breaker-type but in outlet form

**Where to use**: 
- Existing installations where panel upgrade isn't feasible
- When protecting downstream outlets only
- Remodel work with space constraints

**Installation note**: Must be first outlet on the circuit to protect downstream loads

### Branch/Feeder AFCI (Obsolete)

**Historical note**: Required in 2008 NEC but replaced by combination AFCI
**Current status**: No longer manufactured or required
**Replacement**: Use combination AFCI for all new installations

## AFCI Installation Requirements

### Panel Compatibility

**Critical requirement**: AFCI breakers must be listed for specific panel manufacturers
**Common brands**: 
- Square D QO and Homeline AFCI breakers
- Eaton BR and CH AFCI breakers  
- GE THQL and THQB AFCI breakers
- Siemens QP and QT AFCI breakers

**Never mix brands**: Using wrong AFCI breaker voids listings and creates safety hazards

### Multi-Wire Branch Circuits

**Special requirement**: Multi-wire branch circuits in AFCI locations require:
- Handle-tied AFCI breakers, OR
- Two-pole AFCI breaker, OR
- Separate circuits with individual AFCI breakers

**Why**: Shared neutral creates current imbalance that can cause nuisance tripping

### Circuit Modifications

**NEC 210.12(D)**: Where branch circuit wiring is modified, replaced, or extended in areas requiring AFCI protection, the entire branch circuit must be protected.

**Practical application**:
- Adding outlets to existing circuits
- Replacing outlets in AFCI-required areas  
- Extending circuits for remodel work
- Replacing damaged wiring

**Exception**: Minor repairs that don't extend or modify the circuit

## AFCI Installation Examples

### Example 1: New Bedroom Circuit

**Installation**: 15-amp bedroom circuit, standard receptacles
**Requirement**: Combination AFCI breaker required
**Installation**: Replace standard 15-amp breaker with 15-amp combination AFCI
