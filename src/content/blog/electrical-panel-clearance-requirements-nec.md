You're installing a new 200-amp panel in a basement utility room, and the homeowner wants it right next to the water heater "to save space." You explain why that won't work, but they push back: "It's just a few inches." Those few inches aren't just about convenience—they're about safety, code compliance, and creating a workspace that protects anyone working on the electrical system.

This complete guide to NEC 110.26 electrical panel clearances covers working space requirements, equipment access rules, and the safety considerations that make these clearances non-negotiable.

## Why Working Clearances Matter

Electrical panel clearances aren't arbitrary—they're based on decades of accident analysis and safety research:

**Arc flash protection**: Adequate space allows workers to escape dangerous arc flash events
**Access for maintenance**: Proper clearances enable safe testing, troubleshooting, and repairs  
**Emergency response**: Clear access allows quick response to electrical emergencies
**Heat dissipation**: Equipment clearances prevent overheating from poor ventilation

The National Safety Council reports that proper working clearances could prevent over 30% of electrical workplace accidents.

## NEC 110.26 Working Space Requirements

### Three Dimensions of Working Space

**Width** (110.26(A)(2)): Minimum 30 inches wide or width of equipment, whichever is greater

**Height** (110.26(A)(3)): 6 feet 6 inches minimum or height of equipment, whichever is greater

**Depth** (110.26(A)(1)): Varies by voltage and working condition (see table below)

### Working Space Depth Table

**Table 110.26(A)(1)** - Minimum Clear Working Space

| Nominal System Voltage | Condition 1 | Condition 2 | Condition 3 |
|------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0-150V | 3 feet | 3½ feet | 4 feet |
| 151-600V | 3 feet | 3½ feet | 4 feet |
| 601-2500V | 3 feet | 4 feet | 5 feet |

### Working Space Conditions Explained

**Condition 1**: Live parts on one side only, grounded parts on the other side
- Panel on one side, grounded metal wall on other
- Most residential/commercial panel installations

**Condition 2**: Live parts on both sides separated by grounding
- Two panels facing each other with grounded barrier between
- Live parts on both sides, but effectively grounded

**Condition 3**: Live parts on both sides, not grounded
- Two panels facing each other without grounding barrier
- Requires maximum clearance for safety

### Most Common Applications

**Residential panels** (120/240V): 3-foot clearance minimum (Condition 1)
**Commercial panels** (120/208V, 277/480V): 3-foot clearance minimum (Condition 1)  
**Industrial installations**: May require 3½ to 4 feet depending on conditions

## Specific Clearance Requirements

### Width Requirements (110.26(A)(2))

**30-inch minimum**: Even for narrow panels, maintain 30-inch wide workspace
**Equipment width**: If panel is wider than 30 inches, match panel width
**Centered on equipment**: Working space centered on electrical equipment

**Common violations**:
- Panels installed in narrow hallways
- Adjacent walls or equipment reducing working width
- Assuming panel width equals working space width

### Height Requirements (110.26(A)(3))

**6 feet 6 inches minimum**: Standard requirement for most installations
**Equipment height**: If equipment exceeds 6'6", provide clearance to match height
**Measured from floor**: Clear height from standing surface to any obstruction

**Obstructions to avoid**:
- Ductwork, piping, or conduit at head level
- Storage shelves or cabinets above panel
- Low ceiling installations without variance

### Depth Requirements Details

**Measuring depth**: From front of panel to any obstruction
**Full depth required**: Entire width and height must have proper depth
**No encroachment**: Storage, equipment, or materials cannot encroach on working space

**3-foot clearance examples**:
- Residential panel with clear space in front
- Panel on exterior wall with no obstructions
- Basement panel with adequate room for worker

**3½-foot clearance examples**:  
- Panels facing each other with grounded divider
- Panel opposite grounded switchgear
- Industrial applications with grounded barriers

## Equipment Access Requirements (110.26(B))

### At Least One Entrance

**90% rule**: Working spaces under 25 square feet need only one entrance
**Large spaces**: Working spaces 25 square feet or larger need two entrances
**Entrance size**: Minimum 24 inches wide × 6 feet 6 inches high

### Two Entrance Requirements

**When required**: Working space over 25 square feet (5×5 feet or equivalent)
**Separation**: Entrances must be on opposite ends of working space where possible
**Exception**: Single entrance allowed if working space is doubled

**Calculating working space area**:
- Width × depth = working space area
- 30" × 36" = 7.5 sq ft (one entrance OK)
- 48" × 84" = 28 sq ft (two entrances required)

### Entrance Obstructions

**Doors and gates**: Must open at least 90 degrees and not encroach on working space
**Personnel doors**: Cannot be locked from the egress side
**Access barriers**: Removable barriers acceptable if easily opened

## Illumination and Headroom (110.26(D) & (E))

### Illumination Requirements

**Artificial lighting required**: Working spaces around service equipment require permanent lighting
**Light level**: Sufficient for safe work (typically 50+ foot-candles)
**Switch location**: Light switches must be accessible from working space entrance
**Emergency lighting**: Consider battery backup for critical installations

### Headroom Requirements  

**6 feet 6 inches minimum**: Standard headroom for most installations
**Service equipment exceptions**: Some overhead services may have reduced headroom requirements
**Sloped ceilings**: Maintain minimum headroom over entire working space

## Common Clearance Violations

### 1. Storage in Working Space
**Violation**: Using panel area for storage, tools, or materials
**Code reference**: 110.26(A) - working space must be kept clear
**Solution**: Designate separate storage areas outside working space

### 2. Equipment Placement
**Violation**: Water heaters, HVAC units, or other equipment in working space  
**Code reference**: 110.26(A) - clear working space required
**Solution**: Relocate conflicting equipment outside required clearances

### 3. Insufficient Width
**Violation**: Panels in narrow closets or between walls
**Code reference**: 110.26(A)(2) - 30-inch minimum width
**Solution**: Widen opening or relocate panel to compliant location

### 4. Access Obstructions
**Violation**: Locked rooms, blocked doorways, or difficult access routes
**Code reference**: 110.26(B) - ready access required  
**Solution**: Ensure clear, unlocked access to working space

### 5. Height Violations
**Violation**: Low ductwork, piping, or storage above panel
**Code reference**: 110.26(A)(3) - 6'6" minimum height
**Solution**: Relocate obstructions or raise ceiling clearance

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I store anything in the electrical panel clearance area?
No. NEC 110.26(A) requires the working space to be kept clear. Even temporary storage violates this requirement and creates safety hazards.

### Does the panel door swing count as part of the working space?
No. Working space is measured from the front of the equipment when doors are closed. The door must be able to open fully within or beyond the working space.

### Can I get a variance for existing installations with insufficient clearance?
Possibly, depending on local jurisdiction. You'll need to demonstrate equivalent safety through other means and follow the local variance process.

### Do subpanels need the same clearances as main panels?
Yes. All electrical panels and switchboards require the same working clearances regardless of whether they're main panels or subpanels.

### What if my basement ceiling is only 6 feet high?
You need a variance or must relocate the panel. The 6'6" height requirement has very limited exceptions and cannot simply be ignored.
